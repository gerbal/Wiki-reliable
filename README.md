##About The Project

Wiki-reliable is a final project for [INLS 560](http://silshack.github.io/fall2013/) at [SILS UNC](http://sils.unc.edu).

Our goal is to give a user a basic, easy, and straightforward score to help in evaluating the reliability of any wikipedia article.

##How We built it

Wiki-reliable is built in Javascript using the [Chrome APIs](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/api_index.html).
